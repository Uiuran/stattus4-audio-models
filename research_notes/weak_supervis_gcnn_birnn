Architecture
- (Spectrogram) -(1)-> 2D-GCNN ->(?) BiRNN (temporal detail) ->(?)
- Mean Average on FNN SigmoidxSoftmax output -> Cross entropy sum_batch(P log O + (1-P) log (1-O))

(1) - Each spectrogram in the mini-batch is binned to have an n-by-n resolution in for the filter-bank size, 3x3 in this paper,
ending to have Nf/3 channels output and Nt/3 timestamps, padded with same to output Nt/3 time in with frequencies bin of size 3.

Mini-batch balancing

-Balance batchs so the less frequent is at most 5 times lesser in quantity than the most frequent class sample.

Hyperparam Tuning Strategies

- Dynamical learning-rate
- Average accuracy of diverse hyperparams (cross-validated diverse hyperparams) [mean on cross validation sets and in all hyperparams]
  -- Implement algorithms to search in parameters space such Genetic Algorithm or others that dosnt depend on topological (i.e. convexity) requiriments.
