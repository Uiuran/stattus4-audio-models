# Weakly-Supervised GCNN BiRNN

## Summary: Attention and Localization

In summary, in our framework, attention is used for
global event-independent frame-level feature selection, while
the event-dependent localization is used to find the locations
of each event.

## Weakly-Supervisation Labelling 

The training process would be weakly supervised due to the unobserved latent variables, namely the acoustic 
event locations. This is similar to the process of weakly-supervised image segmentation with only per-image labels.

## Architecture
- (Spectrogram) -(1)-> 2D-GCNN ->(?) BiRNN (temporal detail) ->(?)
- Mean Average on FNN SigmoidxSoftmax output -> Cross entropy sum_batch(P log O + (1-P) log (1-O))

(1) - Each spectrogram in the mini-batch is binned to have an n-by-n resolution in for the filter-bank size, 3x3 in this paper,
ending to have Nf/3 channels output and Nt/3 timestamps, padded with same to output Nt/3 time in with frequencies bin of size 3.

## Mini-batch balancing

-Balance batchs so the less frequent is at most 5 times lesser in quantity than the most frequent class sample.

## Hyperparam Tuning Strategies

- Dynamical learning-rate
- Average accuracy of diverse hyperparams (cross-validated diverse hyperparams) [mean on cross validation sets and in all hyperparams]
  -- Implement algorithms to search in parameters space such Genetic Algorithm or others that dosnt depend on topological (i.e. convexity) requiriments.

### Spectrogram

### Audio Time-Series

## Attention

Attention at Frame Level is a sigmoid function with the linearly transformed frame as an input signal

## Localization
 Localizing the acoustic events occurring in the audio recording would
be meaningful given that the labels are in chunk-level rather
than frame-level.
Localization defines as a vector of num_of_classes_size with a linear transform of the input.
It is of the same size of the output. It does gives a notion of the existence of at last 1 event of the classified tag in the frame.


### Chunk-Level

Definition of a chunk : division of the audio in the second scale (1 to 3).
In each chunk, Definition of a Frame: chunking in smaller units of 32 samples/ms (in the case of 16khz sampling rate). This gives 500 Frames per Chunk .

While the introduced attention method can alleviate the
over-fitting problem especially when the input is chunk-level
features. Longer input means more noise was fed into the
model.

### Output loss function
Finally each frame can generate one prediction for the audio tags. Their results should be averaged together to obtain the final predictions.
Feed final prediction in the final cross-entropy loss function and do backprop.
Attention factor of the GCNN is applied (multiplied) to the output of each Frame to give local importance of the Frame in the Tagging.
