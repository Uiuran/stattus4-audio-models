(a) Downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained
to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (Conditional Random Fields)

ResNets Shortcuts
This additional shortcut paths have been shown not only to improve the segmentation accuracy but also to help the network optimization process, resulting in faster convergence of the training [8].
